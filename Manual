Background:
In the very distant future it has been decided, with Earth on a steady path of decay, that the human race use its advanced technology to spread and colonize the universe. You, as the world government’s fleet commander, have full control of this grand expedition. Choose wisely on where you wish to populate and how thin you wish to spread your forces, for your wrongdoings will be the downfall of the entire human race. 
How to Play:
You can select any ships you own simply by left clicking on them individually or by dragging the left mouse button to select a group. Once you’ve selected a ship or ships, you can right click anywhere and the ship will move there. If you guide your ship to a planet, the ship will disappear and populate the planet. Once you have populated a planet, your resources will slowly increase, but that planet is now a target to natural disasters, which will take away from some of your resources. You may right click a planet you own to bring up an information and upgrade menu, specific to that planet. You have options to upgrade the planet’s city, defences, or research, which all contribute to your survival in one way or another, or you may recruit ships to keep exploring the universe. The size of the planet is significant as well. If a larger planet is populated, you will receive more resources from it compared to a smaller planet. Try to upgrade as many planets as you can. 

Controls:

To select an object, click the left mouse button on the object.
